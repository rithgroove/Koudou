The behaviors and attributes of the agents and of the simulation are described by the file in `config/behavioral`. This page will describe what each file in this directory does and some attributes in it as an example.

# condition.csv
This file is responsible for declaring **conditional states** that the simulation or the agent may have. For example, this file may declare when an agent is considered "at work" or when the simulation has the attribute "is evac"

## Parameters
### target
This described who will have this condition, the agent or the simulation.
### name
Name of the condition.
### attribute
In order for the target to have this condition, an attribute must be checked (otherwise this condition would be a simple attribute). This parameter defines the attributed that will be checked.

There is special case, this attribute can be called `random`, and in that case, the value to be checked is generated randomly
### operator
The comparison operator. [equal, not_equal, less_than, greate_than]
### value
The value that the previously specified attribute will be compared to. This value can also be a pointer to another attribute, in this case, it should start with $
### min/max
If the attribute parameter is `random`, these fields will determine the interval of the random generator
### type
The type of the elements to be compared.

# profession.csv
Describes the possible **professions**, their workplaces and work hours, and the distribution of the agents that will have each profession.

# attributes/attribute_basic.csv
Describes **numerical attributes** that the simulation or every agent will have.

# attributes/attribute_option.csv
Describes **categorical attributes** of the simulation or the agents. This means that each attribute will have one of the possible values described in this file

# attributes/attribute_updateable.csv
This file describes **attributes that update each step** of the simulation by a set amount. For example, the energy of each agent will decrease for each passing moment of its futile life until it sleeps and restores its energy.


# attributes/attribute_schedule.csv
Describes **attributes that will only start existing after certain time**. This is useful if you want to trigger an infection or evacuation only after some time has passed.

# behavior/behavior_normal.csv
Please refer to the [Action and Behaviors](https://github.com/caranha/Koudou/wiki/Action-and-Behaviors) page.

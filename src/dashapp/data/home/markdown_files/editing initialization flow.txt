When Koudou is executed, the flow of the program is as follows (words inside quotes are options in the parameter file):
1. Loads the Map
    * First, it tries to find and load the cached map if exists, this cache is specified in the the option "MAP_CACHE"
    * If the cache does not exists, it will create a map from a .osm file defined in "MAP". This process happens in the following order
        * Get Nodes and Ways from the osm file
        * Connect the Nodes using the information in the Ways to build the streets and buildings
        * Get the connections that are roads and tag them as such (this is done using information in the Ways)
            * A main road is defined, this is the graph used in the path finding
        * Create the Places
            * For each place (a building, park, house, etc), the program creates a new node in the center of it called centroid, this is the point of access to this place and it is connected to the main road
        * Tags the places using the information in the osm file
        * Since the osm file is usually incomplete, more information can be added using a CSV.
            * The parameter "BUILDING_TAGS" is a path to the csv used in this step
            * This file determines a number of untagged places to be of a determined type in each coordinate of the map
        * Generated the businesses and residences. These are supertypes of places that have additional characteristics to be used by the agent
    * Since the process of creating the map takes some time, it automatically saves it in the cache file to be used next time
2. Generate the agents (Inside the Simulation class)
    * First, loads the GeneratorAttribute, this class is responsible to give the attributes to the agents
        * These attributes are loaded form the files specified at "SIM_CONFIG.attributes" and "SIM_CONFIG.condition"
    * Creates the agents by assigning an ID and using the GeneratorAttribute to assign its attributes
        * These attributes are created based on config files on the config directory
        * A more descriptive explanation of this proccess of assigning attributes can be found on []
    * Using the GeneratorAttribute, the agents are assigned households
        * This means that they are given an house_id (chosen randomly from the available houses) and who they live with is decided.
        * Additionally, households also have attributes like food in storage
3. Behaviors are loaded.
    * This means that activities are separated into behaviors and can be acessed by the agents following this specific behavior
    * Behaviors are loaded from the files specified on "SIM_CONFIG.behaviors"
4. Simulation attributes are loaded
    * These attributes are loaded form the files specified at "SIM_CONFIG.attributes" and "SIM_CONFIG.condition" and have the target named simulation in the csv
5. Load additional plugins
    * At the moment we load the evacuation and infection modules.
    * More details of each module can be found on their respective pages.
6. Now the simulation can be executed

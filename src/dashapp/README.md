# Dashboard for Simulator Analysis

## Deployment
### Installation
Install the required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, which should already be done when you install 
the simulator.

### Initiate Dashboard
Run `App.py`, and access with link: http://127.0.0.1:8050/
### File Upload
You can analyze the model result with the `upload` module. 
Those files that generated by the simulator can be uploaded and analyzed:
- `activity_hisatory.csv`
- `agent_position_summary.csv` 
- `disease_transition.csv`
- `infection_summary.csv`
- `infection_transition.csv`
- `log.txt`
- `mask_summary.csv`
- `new_infection.csv`

### Model Analysis
You can analyze the model result with the `Configuration` and `Simulation Analysis` module after uploading the result file.

### Clarification
The application is still under development. The current version is a prototype for the final version. If there is any
question or errors when proceeding the analysis, please contact the author.

The dashboard is developed with [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash), [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/), and
[Bootstrap-Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/).
